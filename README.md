# AirFighter
Created by Phillip McIntyre, 2015

## Description
AirFighter is a top-down shooter in which the player utilizes a futuristic
airship to defend Earth from a horde of suicide-bomber aliens. The player
is tasked with preventing no more than 20 ships to pass them as well as
surviving for as long as possible. If the player collides with an enemy
ship or allows too many ships to pass them, they lose the game.

## Run
To run the game, one must open the "index.html" file in Chrome or Firefox. The
player will be then prompted by the title screen to begin playing. After every
defeat, the player will have the option of trying again.

## Controls
To pilot the craft, use the 'W A S D' buttons or the arrow keys. The 'Spacebar' is
used to fire the main weapons. The enemy ships will attempt to speed past the
player, and it is up to them to prevent the enemy from proceeding.
